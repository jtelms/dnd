Field Guide to Elyrium
=======================

# Homebrew Mechanics

### Blood Rain Events

### Status Effects
#### Bleed Tokens

*An attack may cut deep into the flesh, tearing through muscle and into powerful veins. Crimson rivers of vitality pour out across the ground in great quantity throughout Elyrium.*

An attack that deals *Bleed X* (with X stacking), at the end of the target's next turn the target takes Xd4 damage, reducing the *Bleed* count by 1 each turn passively. It may be mitigated by an ally taking the *Help* action, the target or an ally passing a *Medicine* check of DC 10 + X, or by restoration spells.

#### Laid to Rest

*The dead have long been a threat to the average man in this land as the dead rarely stay below the ground. In modern days, there have been great leaps made to make the dead's rest permanent. Whether by faith, magic, or tech, men of all nations have started to create cold graves that no necromancy can penetrate.*

Any item or spell that has *Laid to Rest* prevents *Evil* aligned creatures, *Undead*, or *Fiends* from recieving healing effects for a time, if a turn count is unlisted then healing is prevented for three turns. As well, any creature that dies while under the effects of *Laid to Rest* or posthumously given *Laid to Rest* cannot be revived by any magic without the effect being dispelled or by restoration spells.

# Factions of Elyrium

## The Church of Sanctified Blood
## Forging of Unity
## 
## The Rites of Remolding

*There are many disparate tradtitons amongst congregations in the church, however there is one set of rituals that most flesh and blood cults undertake. The Rites of Remolding are foul invocations that many initiates undertake, sacrificing flesh and blood to the altars in their squelching pits for favor with their god. In return for devotion, brethren may be given various blessings, either as arcane runes dug into the devotee's ruined hide or with a true reforming of their body's structure. Bones may snap and flesh stitch into forms better for the harvest. The holy hymns and canticles of Sactified Blood's catechism speaks to the power found in all, its ability to unify all who partake of its binding communion. The chants preceed foul invocations that actively change body into weapon. "Blood is within us all, with flesh we will bind all together, and together our god will join us all in enlightenment."*

The DM may add modifiers from this table onto **Brethren** creatures before an encounter or any time a creature **Hymns of Bloody Unity** uses that ability. The modifiers are as followed:
| Result(1d6) | Name of Modifier | Effect of Modifier | 
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
|1            | Exhausting       | Attacks incur DC 12 CON roll to take 1 level of *Exhaustion* | 
|2            | Resistant        | Target creature gains 1 elemental resistance |
|3            | Flying           | Target creature gains 20ft., flying speed (doen't stack) |
|4            | Charming         | Attacks incur DC 12 CON roll, fails give *Charmed* status |
|5            | Poisoned         | Attacks give the *Poisoned* status |
|6            | Stitching Flesh  | Target creature gains 2d4 Hit Points each turn |

**Description**
The most machievalian and maddened of those who partake in Yaldaboth's blood sacraments, the Primus are creatures of pure ambition and wanton desires. They take full advantage of their sects's knowledge of remolding their bodies, reshaping their forms to their whims. The Primus often "transcends" their mundane forms, mutating wings of sinew and bone, sprouting multiple heads. A Primus will use others as stepping stones to greater shares of power and agency in the forming of their god's flesh and blood. They eye their obstenible superiors as obstacles to be conquered and consumed, waiting decades for a myriad web of conspiracies to come to fruition, aching for their chance to devour a true shard of The Seed of Life. 
Heretic Primuses are not all that uncommon due to them falling to delusions of grandeur, creating cults in their graven images. A heretic Primus will take their personal transformations further than any other in their sect of flesh and blood. 
One such truly mad creature is Adarapura, the Lady of Flesh, who takes on the shape of a hemaphroditic sphinx with three heads; one of a young woman, a middle aged woman, and a wizened crone. Her flesh being totally exposed with acursed runes carved into it, and, as if to show Yaldaboth's displeasure, her flesh is speckled by maggot-infested tumors.
