Field Guide to Elyrium

# Homebrew Mechanics

### Blood Rain Events
*Across Elyrium red clouds may crawl across the sky, their rains fall with a crimson tone and a ferrous stench. When blood falls from the sky, red mists dance, and the long dead rise from their rests. From the serene fields of Umbert, through the parched deserts of Rivla, to the corrputed lands of Old Ingvarr, the scarlet clouds may appear. Simple storms may raise the freshly dead, stripped of all internal impulse except the most primal and monstrous drives. Stronger storms are marked by veins of red lightning and obscuring mists of blood; from here longer dead creatures claw their way through the softened muck to wreak havoc upon the living, given a malicous intelligence bent of the destruction of life. In their most furious forms, the storms may tear at living flesh itself, as if being buffeted by a sandstorm, the lightning seeks those bold enough to walk through its domain, the winds and rain semeingly attempt to tear through structures to claw at the inhabitants, and the dead come up in coalesced droves; monstrosities are created from ancient graveyards, the dead retain their faculties from life but are driven with a rage to anything alive: these events can best be described as natural disasters and wandering apocalypses at worst.*

Blood rain events come in multiple levels of severity, affecting weather conditions and potential strength of creatures as follows:

- Banal Rains: The sky turns a pale hue somewhere between red and green, red clouds appear in the sky either spontaneously or the clouds turning a blood red color. The sound of thunder accompanied by either the sounds of screams or cackling can be heard in the distance but with no particular direction. Drizzles or small squalls of blood rain may begin to fall. This is a warning sign of worse conditions on the way, no monsters related to the blood rain should appear anywhere except in Old Ingvarr where they "natively" come from.

- Light Rain: Red clouds cover most of the sky all the way to the horizon, there are still pockets of unnatural hues in the sky. A singular crack of thunder gives way to silence, save the sound of falling rain. A light scent of iron and blood wafts through the breeze. The rain itself falls at a light and consistent pace. A haze begins to form along the ground up to about ankle height, this haze forces any creature attempting a *Survival* or *Investigation* check using sight on the ground to be made at *Disadvantage*. A few, low level creatures (CR 1/4 - 1/2) would begin to rise from the ground.

- Full Rain: Blood begins to rapidly fall from the sky, red clouds choke out the sky. The stench of coagulated blood permeates the ground as the soil begins to become slick and sodden with blood. The mists from earlier rains begins to crawl up to waist height, obscuring vision and causing *Pereption* checks that rely on sight incur *Disadvantage*. Creatures (CR 1/4 - 1) begin to claw their way out from their graves, seeking to drag the living below the muck with them. Passively, for every hour a party remains out in the rain, they must make a DC 14 CON save, taking one level of exhaustion on failure. For every hour the party is out in these conditions the DM may roll 1D20 on a 15 or greater, select one character to roll a DC 12 CON save or be *Poisoned*, target rolls a DC 15 Athletics or Acrobatics check or be struck by the effects of the *Witch Bolt* spell.

- Downpour: The sound of blood raining down can best be described as a mix of normal rain and the sound of nails falling on stone. This sound grows to become deafening causing all rolls related to hearing to fail, all that can be heard is poring rain and metallic pinging. The mists of blood rise to envelope all who wander into the rains, causing *Initiative*, *Perception*, and all rolls relying on the senses for detection to be made at *Disadvantage*. Graves across the land stir, the long dead are roused from their slumber and given soft ground to claw their ways out from, creatures (up to CR 5) reanimate. The rains and mists become more hostile to travel in, creeping into character's lungs as they breath in such corrupted air, for every 30 minutes in these conditions characters must roll a DC 16 CON check or be *Poisoned*, taking 1d4 Poison damage every 5 minutes from being afflicted. The rains soak into the earth unnaturally, creating a dark red to black muck that grasps onto ones legs, making all terrain affected *Difficult Terrain*, as well as any creature attempting to fly after standing on this ground must pass a DC 15 STR check or be stuck in the ground for the round. Every 30 minutes a party is out in these conditions, the  DM may roll 1D20 on a 15 or greater, select one character to roll a DC 15 CON save or be *Poisoned*, target rolls a DC 16 Athletics or Acrobatics check or be struck by the effects of the *Witch Bolt* spell.

- Deluge: The metallic ringing becomes a constant clanging, like a hammer pounding into an anvil, a bell being tolled directly into a character's ears. Every 15 minutes, every character in these conditions must roll a DC 15 CON check or be *Deafened* permanently. The iron in the falling blood acts like small blades and needles, without adequate protection characters take 1d4 damage each round, characters must roll a DC 12 CON check, taking *Bleed 1* on failure. This attrition carries over to equipment as well, every 30 minutes in these consitions requires a DC 15 Proficiency check, on failure a character's non-magical equipment starts taking visible damage, after 3 failed checks the affected equipment becomes half as effective (AC minimum of 10 on armor), and after 5 failures affected equipment breaks and becomes ineffective. The mists become even thicker and richer in corruption, affecting characters every minute that they find themselves in thicker clouds of mist, as well as vision becoming drastically obscured, vision of all types is cut down to 30 feet, as well as all *Initiative*, *Perception*, *Survival*, and *Investigation* rolls relying on sight being made with *Double Disadvantage*. The ground becomes a complete mire, becoming *Difficult Terrain*, reducing all movement to 15 feet, requiring a DC 18 STR check to jump or take flight from the ground, and characters are unable to take the *Dash* action. Warrens of the dead and graveyards are completely emptied, creatures from long forgotten battlefields rise to fight the living that no longer recognize them, and the muck mashes together bits of the dead into new monstrous nightmares; creatures (up to CR 10) rise in numerous waves to seek out the living. The weather actively seeks to smite those bild enough to remain out in these conditions, every 10 minutes every character stuck in these conditions must roll a DC 16 Acrobatics or Athletics check or be struck by the effects of the *Lightning Bolt* spell.


### Status Effects
#### Bleed Tokens

*An attack may cut deep into the flesh, tearing through muscle and into powerful veins. Crimson rivers of vitality pour out across the ground in great quantity throughout Elyrium.*

An attack that deals *Bleed X* (with X stacking), at the end of the target's next turn the target takes Xd4 damage, reducing the *Bleed* count by 1 each turn passively. It may be mitigated by an ally taking the *Help* action, the target or an ally passing a *Medicine* check of DC 10 + X, or by restoration spells.

#### Laid to Rest

*The dead have long been a threat to the average man in this land as the dead rarely stay below the ground. In modern days, there have been great leaps made to make the dead's rest permanent. Whether by faith, magic, or tech, men of all nations have started to create cold graves that no necromancy can penetrate.*

Any item or spell that has *Laid to Rest* prevents *Evil* aligned creatures, *Undead*, or *Fiends* from recieving healing effects for a time, if a turn count is not listed then healing is prevented for three turns. As well, any creature that dies while under the effects of *Laid to Rest* or posthumously given *Laid to Rest* cannot be revived by any magic without the effect being dispelled or by restoration spells.

# Factions of Elyrium

## The Church of Sanctified Blood
## Forging of Unity
## 
## The Rites of Remolding

*There are many disparate tradtitons amongst congregations in the church, however there is one set of rituals that most flesh and blood cults undertake. The Rites of Remolding are foul invocations that many initiates undertake, sacrificing flesh and blood to the altars in their squelching pits for favor with their god. In return for devotion, brethren may be given various blessings, either as arcane runes dug into the devotee's ruined hide or with a true reforming of their body's structure. Bones may snap and flesh stitch into forms better for the harvest. The holy hymns and canticles of Sactified Blood's catechism speaks to the power found in all, its ability to unify all who partake of its binding communion. The chants preceed foul invocations that actively change body into weapon. "Blood is within us all, with flesh we will bind all together, and together our god will join us all in enlightenment."*

The DM may add modifiers from this table onto **Brethren** creatures before an encounter or any time a creature **Hymns of Bloody Unity** uses that ability. The modifiers are as followed:
| Result(1d6) | Name of Modifier | Effect of Modifier | 
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
|1            | Exhausting       | Attacks incur DC 12 CON roll to take 1 level of *Exhaustion* | 
|2            | Resistant        | Target creature gains 1 elemental resistance |
|3            | Flying           | Target creature gains 20ft., flying speed (doen't stack) |
|4            | Charming         | Attacks incur DC 12 CON roll, fails give *Charmed* status |
|5            | Poisoned         | Attacks give the *Poisoned* status |
|6            | Stitching Flesh  | Target creature gains 2d4 Hit Points each turn |

**Description**
The most machievalian and maddened of those who partake in Yaldaboth's blood sacraments, the Primus are creatures of pure ambition and wanton desires. They take full advantage of their sects's knowledge of remolding their bodies, reshaping their forms to their whims. The Primus often "transcends" their mundane forms, mutating wings of sinew and bone, sprouting multiple heads. A Primus will use others as stepping stones to greater shares of power and agency in the forming of their god's flesh and blood. They eye their obstenible superiors as obstacles to be conquered and consumed, waiting decades for a myriad web of conspiracies to come to fruition, aching for their chance to devour a true shard of The Seed of Life. 
Heretic Primuses are not all that uncommon due to them falling to delusions of grandeur, creating cults in their graven images. A heretic Primus will take their personal transformations further than any other in their sect of flesh and blood. 
One such truly mad creature is Adarapura, the Lady of Flesh, who takes on the shape of a hemaphroditic sphinx with three heads; one of a young woman, a middle aged woman, and a wizened crone. Her flesh being totally exposed with acursed runes carved into it, and, as if to show Yaldaboth's displeasure, her flesh is speckled by maggot-infested tumors.

***Lair and Lair Actions***

The Avatar of Blood's Wrath is a writhing mass of flesh and bodies, moving of its chaotic internal impulses, influenced by the malignant will of the flesh god it is made in the image of. Usually, if this horror is to be found, it will be found gestating inside a major pit of the Church of Sanctified Blood, connected to major vessels and fed mounds of sacrifices. Its lair is a pit replete with pools of stagnating blood and corpses as both sacrifice and decoration, limbs laid out in macabre shrines. However, anywhere can become its home, as it can root its tendrils into the earth, churning the bodies of the dead into a sludgy slurry, able to raise walls of gore to protect itself from without and to trap its prey within.

**Lair Actions**

On initiative count 20 (winning intiative ties), the creature takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; teh creature cannot use the same effect two rounds in a row.

- Pools of blood within 120 of the creature sprout grasping hands that seek to drag enemy creatures beneath their surface. Any creature within 10ft. of a pool must succeed on a DC 15 STR save or be dragged 20 ft. under the surface of the pool of blood and *Restrained*.
- Warped eaters of carrion erupt in columns of cacophony, driven toward the fresh meat that entered their breeding grounds, hidden within staleing corpses. Up to three targets are harrased by these flesh locusts, forcing the targets to roll a DC 15 CON save, on fail the targets take 3d10 piercing damage or half as much on a success.
- From various dangling blood vessels and gastric tracts a fine mist of blood and digestive juices dance in clouds across the pit. Up to three 15 ft. sphere shaped clouds form in the pit, these clouds are treated as completely obscuring and cannot be seen through except with *Truesight*. Any creature that ends their turn within one of these clouds, or if the cloud moves into a creature, takes 2d20 acid damage or poison damage. The clouds can be moved by the creature as a lair action, as an action, or as a legendary action. The clouds disappear if the creature dies.

**Regional Effects**

The region around The Avatar's lair is warped by corruption from The Seed of Life and by the faithful of the Church. This creates one or more of the following effects:

- The land within 6 miles of the lair takes twice as long to traverse, the land being saturated with blood and giving way to foot traffic as if it were mud. The air and land reek with the smell of iron and fetid water.
- Water sources within 1 mile of the lair are fouled by the influence of the cretaure and its followers, waterways take on the consistency of coagulated blood and taste of rust. Enemies of the creature who drink the water regurgitate it immediately and are *Poisoned* until healed as their body rejects the foul liquid.
- Within 1 mile of the lair, there is a consistent *Blood Rain* and every hour one character must make a DC 12 DEX or Perception check, being struck by *Witch Bolt* on failure.
- Mists of blood obscures the land within 6 miles of the lair.
**Description**

## The Tribes of the Ossificans

## Blessed of Yaldaboth

## Blood Rain Abominations
## Called by the Rains
*When scarlet lightning illuminates crimson clouds and the stench of fetid iron follows rain, that is the call of the God of the Northerners. Accompanying these foul rains are the cries of the dead as they claw their way out from the slurried ground, making their way towards any signs of life, marching with a maddened hunger.*
    - From *Studies On The Gods of the North*, by Dr. Issac Harlowe

The creatures of this subfaction appear when there is a *Blood Rain Event* occuring in the local area, they also have a need to attack and devour living creatures that are not part of *Blood Rain Abominations*.
## Danse Macabre
*As the crimson mists crawl across the landscape, the smell of iron wrenches into the noses of those poor enough to be caught in the rain, and as the color of blood washes over anything the rain touches, the echoing cries of the dead begin to rumble beneath the ground. Even the coldest graves begin to stir with malign unlive, wrenching the peaceful dead back into a painful mockery of their previous existence. The corruption of The Seed of Life cannot be escaped, it comes for both the living and the dead.*
    - From the *Apocalypsos Demonicon*, written by Aeobarth of Holfield 

The DM may modify and use any stat sheet as one the *Blood Rain Abominations*, key considerations are as follows:
    - Restrictions or removal of spell casting abilities
    - Changing of elemental damage types to *Acid*, *Poison*, *Bleeding*, or physical damage types
    - Adding in revival mechanics from stat blocks listed below
    - Adjusting or changing resistances, especially against conditions like *Poisoned* and *Charmed*
    - Adjusting of Ability Scores, emphasizing STR and CON, as well as reducing INT, WIS, and CHA, as a general rule
    - Creatures are considered *Undead* in addition to other types and typically fall under *Evil* or *Unaligned* alignments
